* * EXWM
If I would like a machine to use exwm, I load this org file in the machine-specific.el
** Basic setup
This is a hodgepodge of stuff and I really need to organize this. I also need to figure out how to make the EXWM Randr Stuff system dependent but I'm too lazy
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :exports none
  (use-package exwm)
  (require 'exwm-randr)
  (require 'exwm-config)
  (setq exwm-randr-workspace-output-plist '(0 "DP-2" 1 "DP-0"))
  (exwm-randr-enable)
  (exwm-config-default)
#+END_SRC
** Allow focus to follow the mouse
I always found it quite painful to move around without this
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq mouse-autoselect-window t
	focus-follows-mouse t)
#+END_SRC

** Keybinds
I need to add to this. More Super-key functions would be nice to reduce all the mouse use I have to do
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (global-set-key (kbd "s-d") 'async-shell-command)
#+END_SRC
** Start programs in char mode
EXWM distinguishes between two minor modes, char and line. I'm not entirely sure what the difference is but it has something to do with sending key combos.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq exwm-manage-configurations '((t char-mode t)))
#+END_SRC
